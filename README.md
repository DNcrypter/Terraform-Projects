## Introduction

This repository contains a variety of Terraform configurations, each targeting different infrastructure use cases across popular cloud platforms like **AWS**, **Azure**, and **Google Cloud**. The goal is to provide ready-to-use Terraform templates that you can easily customize for your own projects. Whether you are setting up a secure VPC, deploying a web application, or managing scalable infrastructure, you'll find a project that fits your needs.

The projects in this repository follow best practices for:
- **Security:** Using least-privilege IAM roles, encrypted resources, and secure access management.
- **Scalability:** Configuring auto-scaling groups, load balancers, and database clustering.
- **Monitoring:** Incorporating monitoring tools like AWS CloudWatch for real-time alerts and logs.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Optimizing resource usage while staying within cloud providers' free tiers where possible.

## Prerequisites

Before using any of the Terraform configurations in this repository, you need to have the following tools installed and set up:

- **Terraform**: [Download and Install Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- **Cloud Provider Account**: Create an account with your desired cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).

- **AWS CLI (optional)**: If working with AWS, you can install and configure the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).
- **IAM Permissions**: Ensure your IAM user has sufficient permissions to create and manage the resources defined in the projects (e.g., EC2, RDS, IAM).

## Project List

### Project 1: Production-Ready Terraform AWS Infrastructure
This project demonstrates how to use Terraform to provision a production-ready, scalable, and secure AWS infrastructure. It includes:

- **VPC** with private and public subnets.
- **EC2 instances** with Auto Scaling.
- **RDS** for database services (MySQL/PostgreSQL) with automated backups and encryption.
- **S3** for secure storage with encryption enabled.
- **IAM roles** with least-privilege permissions.
- **CloudWatch** for monitoring and logging.

This project is designed to be industry-ready, focusing on high availability, security, and performance.

## Installation and Setup

### Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/terraform-projects.git
cd terraform-projects
```
### Install Terraform
Ensure that you have Terraform installed.
```bash
terraform -v 
```
If not, install it.
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install terraform
```

### Configure Cloud Provider CLI (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- AWS CLI:
```
aws configure
```
- Azure CLI:
```
az login
```
- Google Cloud SDK:
```
gcloud auth login
```


### Initialize Terraform
After configuring your provider and setting up the necessary environment, navigate to the project directory and initialize the Terraform configuration:
```
terraform init

```
### Plan and Apply
Run the following command to see the execution plan before applying the configuration:
```
terraform plan
```
If the plan looks good, apply the configuration to create the infrastructure:

```
terraform apply
```
To tear down the infrastructure, you can use:

```
terraform destroy

```
