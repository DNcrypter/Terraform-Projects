## üçÅIntroduction
This project demonstrates how to use **Terraform** to provision a production-ready, scalable, and secure AWS infrastructure. The infrastructure is designed to deploy a simple web application, with high availability, security, and monitoring. The project includes components like:

- Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with public and private subnets.
- EC2 instances with Auto Scaling for handling varying traffic loads.
- RDS database (MySQL/PostgreSQL) with automated backups and encryption.
- S3 bucket for secure storage.
- IAM roles and security groups following the principle of least privilege.
- CloudWatch for monitoring and logging.
  
The infrastructure is designed to be production-level and follows industry best practices for security, scalability, and maintainability.

## üçÅPrerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Terraform**: Version 1.x or higher installed. 
- **AWS Account**: Set up an AWS account.
- **AWS CLI**: Configure your AWS CLI with your access keys using `aws configure`. 
- **IAM Permissions**: Ensure your IAM user has sufficient permissions to create and manage the resources defined in this project, such as EC2, VPC, RDS, and IAM roles.

## üçÅInstallation
### Clone the repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/terraform-aws-infrastructure.git
cd terraform-aws-infrastructure

```
### Install Terraform
Ensure that you have Terraform installed.
```bash
terraform -v
```
If not, install it.
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt-get install terraform
```
### Configure AWS CLI
Ensure that your AWS CLI is configured with the proper credentials and default region:

```bash
aws configure
```
You will be prompted to enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Region, and Output Format.

## üçÅSetup
### Initialize Terraform
Navigate to the project directory, then initialize the Terraform project:
```bash
 terraform init
```
This command will download the necessary provider plugins and set up the backend configuration.

### Configure Variables
Update the terraform.tfvars file with your environment-specific values. For example:
```bash
aws_region = "us-east-1"
aws_profile = "default"
instance_type = "t3.micro"
db_username = "admin"
db_password = "securepassword123"
```

### Plan the Infrastructure
Before applying the configuration, it's a good idea to run a Terraform plan to see what resources will be created:
```bash
terraform plan
```
### Apply the Configuration
Once you're satisfied with the plan, apply the configuration to create the resources:
```bash
terraform apply
```
You'll be prompted to confirm that you want to apply the changes. Type yes to proceed.

### Destroy the Infrastructure (Optional)
To tear down all the resources created by Terraform, you can use the following command:

```bash
terraform destroy
```
This will delete all the resources defined in your Terraform configuration.

## üçÅFuture Improvements
While this project is already designed to be production-ready, there are several areas where improvements can be made:
- **CI/CD Integration:** Integrate Terraform with CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) to automate the deployment of infrastructure.
- **Automated Backups for EC2 Instances:** Implement automated snapshots or AMI backups for EC2 instances to ensure quick recovery.
- **Monitoring and Alerting:** Set up CloudWatch Alarms to notify of any issues such as EC2 health failures, high CPU usage, or RDS performance issues.
